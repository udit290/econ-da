## Projects

- **[Semantic Data Model Creation in Power BI](https://github.com/udit290/Projects/blob/3e6cc0fac353b44a98b99310f87da6cbb9ed7dbb/Basic%20Data%20Model.pbix)**  
  Applied data modeling and semantic modeling principles to construct a star schema in Power BI using a fictional yet real-world relevant chocolate company dataset. Transformed raw data into an organized, query-efficient structure, enabling in-depth business analysis and reporting.

- **[Empirical Analysis of the EKC Hypothesis for Municipal Solid Waste Across Indian States (Research Paper)](https://github.com/udit290/Projects/blob/3e6cc0fac353b44a98b99310f87da6cbb9ed7dbb/EKC_MSW_Report.pdf)**
 **Abstract**
- This study investigates the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis in the context of municipal solid waste (MSW) generation across 31 Indian states and Union Territories during 2013-2021. Using fixed effects panel regression, we explore whether economic growth initially increases MSW generation and subsequently reduces it beyond a certain income threshold. The results confirm an inverted U-shaped relationship between Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) and MSW, supporting the EKC hypothesis. Sectoral drivers such as education, tourism, industrial activity, energy consumption, and agricultural land use are incorporated into the analysis. Higher education levels are associated with reduced waste generation, while industrial expansion and electricity consumption are positively correlated with MSW. In contrast, tourism activity is found to be statistically insignificant in influencing waste levels. The study also highlights considerable interstate heterogeneity, emphasizing that income growth alone does not ensure environmental improvements without supportive infrastructure and policy interventions. These findings call for state-specific waste management strategies to align economic development with environmental sustainability.
