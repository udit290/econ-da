# About

Hey people, I'm Bishmay. I am a Research Associate at the Centre for Advanced Financial Research and Learning (CAFRAL), Reserve Bank of India. In the past, I’ve worked as a part-time Research Assistant at [QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org/) and as a Data Science Intern at [Development Data Lab](https://www.devdatalab.org/). I hold a Master’s degree in Economics from Shiv Nadar University, India.

My interests lie primarily in macroeconomic theory, computational macroeconomics, and exploring the use of AI, LLMs, and neural networks in Economics. I primarily work with Python and Stata, and I have experience in both applied empirical and development-focused projects in India, as well as theoretical work in various economic domains. 

I'm open to opportunities and happy to collaborate on projects. Please feel free to reach out to me at [bishmaykbarik@gmail.com](mailto:bishmaykbarik@gmail.com).


### Softwares Used:
Python | Stata | MATLAB | Git | GitHub | Terminal | Streamlit 

### Languages (Programming, Typesetting and Markup)

Python , Bash , TeX , Markdown 

Additionally, some of the binary code formats I’ve been working with recently include WebAssembly (WASM) and Pyodide. I’ve also worked with PyTorch and TensorFlow. Currently, I’m intrigued by JAX and its applications in economic research — particularly in optimization problems in economics and improving computational speeds of various libraries in Python.
