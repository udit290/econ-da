- **[Impact of UPI Adoption on Financial Inclusion](https://github.com/udit290/Projects/blob/a9f248aeb6706d2b33163a7b2af8e68c35cde778/Impact%20of%20UPI%20Adoption%20on%20Financial%20Inclusion.docx)**  
  This paper studies how the rollout of the Unified Payments Interface reshaped formal credit usage across 34 Indian states and union territories from 2012–2024. We construct a continuous treatment measure using average pre-UPI deposits per capita from 2012 to 2015 to capture financial readiness and estimate a heterogeneous difference-in-differences model using credit transactions per capita as the outcome. The results document that UPI led to a statistically significant increase in formal credit activity, with substantially larger impacts in states with deeper pre-existing banking systems. A one-standard-deviation increase in deposit exposure corresponds to roughly a 140 percent rise in post-UPI credit transactions relative to the pre-UPI levels, and event-study tests confirm the absence of differential pre-trends. Overall, UPI amplified existing financial depth by improving digital transaction visibility, suggesting that digital infrastructure is more likely to complement rather than substitute traditional financial development.
  
- **[Empirical Analysis of the EKC Hypothesis for Municipal Solid Waste Across Indian States (Research Paper)](https://github.com/udit290/Projects/blob/3e6cc0fac353b44a98b99310f87da6cbb9ed7dbb/EKC_MSW_Report.pdf)**
- **Abstract:** This study investigates the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis in the context of municipal solid waste (MSW) generation across 31 Indian states and Union Territories during 2013-2021. Using fixed effects panel regression, we explore whether economic growth initially increases MSW generation and subsequently reduces it beyond a certain income threshold. The results confirm an inverted U-shaped relationship between Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) and MSW, supporting the EKC hypothesis. Sectoral drivers such as education, tourism, industrial activity, energy consumption, and agricultural land use are incorporated into the analysis. Higher education levels are associated with reduced waste generation, while industrial expansion and electricity consumption are positively correlated with MSW. In contrast, tourism activity is found to be statistically insignificant in influencing waste levels. The study also highlights considerable interstate heterogeneity, emphasizing that income growth alone does not ensure environmental improvements without supportive infrastructure and policy interventions. These findings call for state-specific waste management strategies to align economic development with environmental sustainability.
